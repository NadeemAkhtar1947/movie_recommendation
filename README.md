# Content based Movie Recommendation System

This system recommends movies based on actors, directors, overview, genres, production companies, etc....



## Documentation

[Documentation](https://linktodocumentation)

Dataset for this project was generated by THE MOVIE DATABASE (TMDB) and i have collected it from Kaggle. link of dataset is given below.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

This dataset consist of two files:-
## a) credits.csv 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_credits.csv
## b) movies.csv
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv

we will merge both datasets on the basis of title. 
movies = movies.merge(credits,on='title')


we will take the required columns on which we are going to make content based recommendation system.
movies = movies[['movie_id','title','cast','crew','overview','genres','keywords','production_companies']]






## Deployment

To deploy this project on local server run

```
  streamlit run app_name(or filename).py
```
To deploy this project on streamlit cloud
please go through this video it better helps.
you will get error on uploading github when you have a file larger than 100MB. To resolve this issue you have to download Git Large File Storage (LFS) that replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com
After downloading, open your Gitbash or command prompt and go to your working directory and then the follow commands one by one:

## Installation

Install lfs run

```
  git lfs install
```
to track the large pkl file (>100MB) run 
```  
  git lfs track "*.pkl"
```
then add gitattributes
```  
  git add .gitattributes
```
then add your pkl file
```  
  git add file.pkl
```
commit to change
```  
  git commit -m "Add design file"
